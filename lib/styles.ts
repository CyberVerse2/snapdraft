Render the subjects with soft, rounded facial features, gentle and expressive eyes, and detailed yet whimsical hair, using painterly textures and warm, vibrant colors.

Render the subject with sharp, slightly angular faces, expressive and bold anime eyes, and stylized, spiky or chunky hair, outlined with strong, hand-drawn linework. Use dramatic cel-shaded shadows and an earthy, natural color palette. The background and overall scene should have the painterly, warm feel of Narutoâ€™s Hidden Leaf Village settings. Add subtle ninja details or accessories if appropriate, such as ninja headbands, utility pouches, or symbols from the Naruto universe. The result should look like a frame from the Naruto anime, with iconic anime facial features and dynamic shading.'
